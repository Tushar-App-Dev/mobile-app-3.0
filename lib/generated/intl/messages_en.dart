Sugarcane accounts for 79% of sugar produced globally (most of the rest is made from sugar beets). About 70% of the sugar produced comes from Saccharum officinarum and its hybrids. All sugarcane species can interbreed, and the major commercial cultivars are complex hybrids. It was also introduced to southern China and India by Austronesian traders around 1200 to 1000 BC. The Persians and Greeks encountered the famous reeds that produce honey without bees in India between the sixth and fourth centuries BC. They adopted and then spread sugarcane agriculture.[5] Merchants began to trade in sugar, which was considered a luxurious and expensive spice, from India. In the 18th century, sugarcane plantations began in the Caribbean, South American, Indian Ocean, and Pacific island nations."),

The onion plant produces pink or white flowers clustered on stalks. The bulbs are formed just above the flattened stem of the plant by overlapping leaves. The bulb is made up of several layers, each corresponding to a leaf. They are are generally oval but shape can be variable and occur in clusters of 3–18 to a plant. The bulb is protected by a membrane which turns to a papery coat. Onion plants can reach a height of 50 cm (20 in) and are grown as annuals, harvested after one growing season.

The stem terminates in a spike that is made up on individual spikelets, each possessing 3–9 florets. The wheat fruit develops within the spikelets, maturing to a seed (kernel). Wheat can reach 1.2 m (4 ft) in height and like other cereals, has been developed into different varieties that are adapted to planting at different times of the year. Spring wheat is planted for a late summer harvest, whereas Winter wheat is planted for harvesting in early to mid summer. Overwintering varieties are more commonly grown in regions with mild winters. Wheat may be referred to by variety and these include durum or macaroni wheat (Triticum durum), club wheat (Triticum compactum), spelt wheat (Triticum spelta) and bread wheat (Triticum aestivum).

The tree produces bright red flowers singly at the tips of the branches and a rounded hexagonal fruit with a thick pink-red skin. The fruit has a thick, leathery rind which protects the pulp[ and seeds inside. The inside of the fruit is separated into compartments by white spongy tissue. Each compartment contains seeds and pulp. Each pomegranate fruit may contain as many as 600 seeds. Pomegranate trees can reach a height of 10 m (33 ft) and can be very long lived, although their economic lifespan is usually between 12 and 15 years.

    "descriptions6" : MessageLookupByLibrary.simpleMessage("The Common or European grapevine (Vitis vinifera) is a long stemmed, woody vine (liana) which produces high value berries, or grapes. The vines can reach lengths in excess of 30 m and can live for many years with proper management. The leaves of the grape vine are alternately arranged on the stem and are long and broad with 5–7 lobes, typically reaching sizes of 5–20 cm (2.0–7.9 in). Flowers are produced in clusters and fruit. The fruit is a berry known as a grape and grows in clusters from the vine. In wild species, the fruit is 6 mm (1/5 in) in diameter and ripens to dark purple to black with a pale wax bloom. In cultivated plants, the berry is usually much larger, up to 3 cm (1.2 in) long and can be green, red or purple. Vitis vinifera is native to the Mediterranean region, central Europe, and southwestern Asia but is cultivated on every continent except Antarctica. Most grape cultivation centers on the use of Vitis vinifera, however, in North America the related species Vitis labrusca, Vitis riparia and Vitis rotundifolia are also grown. Vitis amurensis is native to Asia and has been hybridized with Vitis vinifera to produce cold tolerant grapevine varieties."),

Unsurprisingly, the plants are most commonly grown for the harvest of their fruits, which are used as a spice. Hot peppers are perennial plants with varying structure. They can be herbaceous or shrub-like but are generally branching with green-brown stems and simple oval leaves. The plants produces flowers with five teeth (petals) which are usually white in color. Chilli pepper plants can reach heights in the range of 0.5 to 1.5 m (1.6–4.9 ft) tall and although they are perennial species, they are commonly grown as annuals, with fruit being harvested for one growing season. Chilli peppers may also be referred to as hot peppers or hot chillis.
