  "SoilTempShortDesc": "Soil temperature is simply the measurement of the warmth in the soil. It is one of the major factor for good plant health and plant growth.",
  "SoilTempQue": "Why is soil temperature important?",
  "SoilTemp1":"1. Soil temperature directly affects plant growth. In other words, nearly every crop slows down its growth when soil temperatures are below 90C and above 50C.",
  "SoilTemp2":"2. Germination of various seeds requires different soil temperature ranges.  (For example, maize starts to germinate at soil temperatures from 7 to 100C.)",
  "SoilTemp3":"3. Most organisms within soil thrive at temperatures between 25-350C.)",
  "SoilTemp4":"4. Nitrification requires a soil temperature of 320C.",
  "SoilMoist1": "The soil moisture content is the quantity of water present in soil.",
  "SoilMoist2": "The amount of moisture or soil water is important to know because:",
  "SoilMoist3": "1.The yield of a crop is more often determined by the amount of water available rather than the deficiency of other food nutrients.",
  "SoilMoist4": "2. Soil water acts as a nutrient itself.",
  "SoilMoist5":"3. It regulates soil temperature.",
  "SoilMoist6": "4. It is a principal constituent of the growing plant.",
  "UVIData1": "       UVI Index is the measure of the level of UV radiation in atmosphere. It will show as normal, moderate and extreme depending on the level of radiation.",
  "UVIData2": "        UV radiation favorably influences the life cycle of plants,it boosts the intensity of photosynthesis processes,facilitating the production of chlorophyll and nutrient absorption.On the other hand,excessive UV exposure can cause protein degradation in leaf cells,leading them to die.",

  "descriptions0": "Grown in tropical and subtropical regions, sugarcane is the world's largest crop by production quantity, with 1.8 billion Tonnes produced in 2017, with Brazil accounting for 40% of the world total. In 2012, the Food and Agriculture Organization estimated it was cultivated on about 26×106 ha (64×106 acres), in more than 90 countries. Sugarcane accounts for 79% of sugar produced globally (most of the rest is made from sugar beets). About 70% of the sugar produced comes from Saccharum officinarum and its hybrids. All sugarcane species can interbreed, and the major commercial cultivars are complex hybrids. It was also introduced to southern China and India by Austronesian traders around 1200 to 1000 BC. The Persians and Greeks encountered the famous reeds that produce honey without bees in India between the sixth and fourth centuries BC. They adopted and then spread sugarcane agriculture.[5] Merchants began to trade in sugar, which was considered a luxurious and expensive spice, from India. In the 18th century, sugarcane plantations began in the Caribbean, South American, Indian Ocean, and Pacific island nations.",
  "pests0": "1. The cane beetle (also known as cane grub) can substantially reduce crop yield by eating roots; it can be controlled with imidacloprid (Confidor) or chlorpyrifos (Lorsban).\n 2. Other important pests are the larvae of some butterfly/moth species, including the turnip moth, the sugarcane borer (Diatraea saccharalis), the African sugarcane borer (Eldana saccharina), the Mexican rice borer (Eoreuma loftini), the African armyworm (Spodoptera exempta), leaf-cutting ants, termites, spittlebugs (especially Mahanarva fimbriolata and Deois flavopicta), and the beetle Migdolus fryanus.\n 3. The planthopper insect Eumetopina flavipes acts as a virus vector, which causes the sugarcane disease ramu stunt.",
  "descriptions1": "Tomato, Lycopersicum esculentum (syn. Solanum lycopersicum and Lycopersicon lycopersicum) is an herbaceous annual in the family Solanaceae grown for its edible fruit. The plant can be erect with short stems or vine-like with long, spreading stems. The stems are covered in coarse hairs and the leaves are arranged spirally. The tomato plant produces yellow flowers, which can develop into a cyme of 3–12, and usually a round fruit (berry) which is fleshy, smoothed skinned and can be red, pink, purple, brown, orange or yellow in color. The tomato plant can grow 0.7–2 m (2.3–6.6 ft) in height and as an annual, is harvested after only one growing season. Tomato may also be referred to as love apple and originates from South America.",
  "pests1":"1. Only use certified disease-free seeds and plants.\n 2. Avoid areas that were planted with peppers or tomatoes during the previous year.\n 3. Avoid overhead watering by using drip or furrow irrigation. Remove and dispose of all diseased plant material. \n 4. Prune plants to promote air circulation. Spraying with a copper fungicide will give fairly good control of the bacterial disease. Follow the instructions on the label. See Table 1 for fungicide products for home garden use.",

  "descriptions2": "Potato, Solanum tuberosum, is an herbaceous perennial plant in the family Solanaceae which is grown for its edible tubers. The potato plant has a branched stem and alternately arranged leaves consisting of leaflets which are both of unequal size and shape. The leaflets can be oval to oblong in shape and the leaves can reach 10–30 cm (4–12 in) in length and 5–15 cm (2–6 in) wide. The potato plant produces white or blue flowers and yellow-green berries. The potato tubers grow underground and generally located in the top 25 cm (10 in) of the soil. The tubers can range in color from yellow to red or purple depending on the variety. Potato plants can reach in excess of 1 m (3.3 ft) in height and are grown as annual plants, surviving only one growing season. Potato may also be referred to as, spud, Irish potato, white potato or Spanish potato and originates from South America.",
  "descriptions3": "Onion, Allium cepa, is an herbaceous biennial in the family Liliaceae grown for its edible bulb. The stem of the plant is a flattened disc at the base and the tubular leaves form a pseudostem where their sheaths overlap. The leaves are either erect or oblique and there are 3–8 per plant. The onion plant produces pink or white flowers clustered on stalks. The bulbs are formed just above the flattened stem of the plant by overlapping leaves. The bulb is made up of several layers, each corresponding to a leaf. They are are generally oval but shape can be variable and occur in clusters of 3–18 to a plant. The bulb is protected by a membrane which turns to a papery coat. Onion plants can reach a height of 50 cm (20 in) and are grown as annuals, harvested after one growing season. Onion may also be referred to by cultivar and these include red or purple onion, shallots and spring onions or scallions. The origin of the onion has not been conclusively determined although it is likely to be somewhere in South East Asia where the gene pool is most diverse.",
  "descriptions4":  "Wheat, is the name given to several plants in the genus Triticum including Triticum aestivum, Triticum compactum, Triticum spelta and Triticum durum, which are annual or biennial grasses grown primarily for their grain. Wheat species possess an erect smooth stem with linear leaves that grow in two rows on either side of the stem with larger 'flag' leaves at the top of the stem. The stem terminates in a spike that is made up on individual spikelets, each possessing 3–9 florets. The wheat fruit develops within the spikelets, maturing to a seed (kernel). Wheat can reach 1.2 m (4 ft) in height and like other cereals, has been developed into different varieties that are adapted to planting at different times of the year. Spring wheat is planted for a late summer harvest, whereas Winter wheat is planted for harvesting in early to mid summer. Overwintering varieties are more commonly grown in regions with mild winters. Wheat may be referred to by variety and these include durum or macaroni wheat (Triticum durum), club wheat (Triticum compactum), spelt wheat (Triticum spelta) and bread wheat (Triticum aestivum). Wheat originated in the Fertile Crescent of the Middle East.",
  "descriptions5": "Pomegranate, Punica granatum, is a deciduous or evergreen tree or shrub in the family Punicaceae grown for its edible fruits. The pomegranate tree is branched and spiny with glossy, leathery, oval to oblong leaves that grow in whorls of five or more on the branches. The tree produces bright red flowers singly at the tips of the branches and a rounded hexagonal fruit with a thick pink-red skin. The fruit has a thick, leathery rind which protects the pulp[ and seeds inside. The inside of the fruit is separated into compartments by white spongy tissue. Each compartment contains seeds and pulp. Each pomegranate fruit may contain as many as 600 seeds. Pomegranate trees can reach a height of 10 m (33 ft) and can be very long lived, although their economic lifespan is usually between 12 and 15 years. Pomegranate may also be referred to as grenadine or Chinese apple and originated from Central Asia, likely in Iran.",
  "descriptions6": "The Common or European grapevine (Vitis vinifera) is a long stemmed, woody vine (liana) which produces high value berries, or grapes. The vines can reach lengths in excess of 30 m and can live for many years with proper management. The leaves of the grape vine are alternately arranged on the stem and are long and broad with 5–7 lobes, typically reaching sizes of 5–20 cm (2.0–7.9 in). Flowers are produced in clusters and fruit. The fruit is a berry known as a grape and grows in clusters from the vine. In wild species, the fruit is 6 mm (1/5 in) in diameter and ripens to dark purple to black with a pale wax bloom. In cultivated plants, the berry is usually much larger, up to 3 cm (1.2 in) long and can be green, red or purple. Vitis vinifera is native to the Mediterranean region, central Europe, and southwestern Asia but is cultivated on every continent except Antarctica. Most grape cultivation centers on the use of Vitis vinifera, however, in North America the related species Vitis labrusca, Vitis riparia and Vitis rotundifolia are also grown. Vitis amurensis is native to Asia and has been hybridized with Vitis vinifera to produce cold tolerant grapevine varieties.",
  "descriptions7": "All chilli peppers are varieties of several plant species in the genus Capsicum, including Capsicum annuum (e.g. jalapeños and cayennes), C. frutescens (e.g. tabasco and piri piri), C. chinense (e.g. habaneros and Scotch bonnet), C. pubescens (e.g. rocoto and locoto) and C. baccatum (e.g. aji peppers) and their hybrids which include some of the hottest peppers known. Unsurprisingly, the plants are most commonly grown for the harvest of their fruits, which are used as a spice. Hot peppers are perennial plants with varying structure. They can be herbaceous or shrub-like but are generally branching with green-brown stems and simple oval leaves. The plants produces flowers with five teeth (petals) which are usually white in color. Chilli pepper plants can reach heights in the range of 0.5 to 1.5 m (1.6–4.9 ft) tall and although they are perennial species, they are commonly grown as annuals, with fruit being harvested for one growing season. Chilli peppers may also be referred to as hot peppers or hot chillis. C. annuum species are believed to have originated from Mexico, while the others are all likely to have originated from South America.",
  "descriptions8": "Pea, Pisum sativum, is an annual herbaceous legume in the family Fabaceae grown for its edible seeds and seedpods. The pea plant can be bushy or climbing, with slender stems which attach to a substrate using tendrils. Each leaf has 1–3 pairs of oval leaflets and can reach 1–6 cm in length. The plant produces white, red or purple flowers and swollen or compressed green seedpods which can be straight or curved. The pods can range in size from 4 to 15 cm long and 1.5–2.5 cm wide. Each pod contains between 2 and 10 seeds, or peas. The pea plant is an annual plant, surviving only one growing season and can reach 30–150 cm in height. Pea may also be referred to as garden pea, English pea or green pea and likely originates from Southwest Asia.",
  "descriptions9": "The Common Fig, Ficus carica, is a deciduous tree or shrub in the family Moraceae grown for its edible fruits. The fig tree has numerous spreading branches and palmate leaves. The leaves are deeply lobed and thick with a rough upper surface and hairy lower surface. They have irregular teeth on the margins. The fig fruit is not technically a fruit, but a syconium, a flesh, hollow receptacle with tiny flowers on the inside walls. The fig is roughly oval or pear-shaped and can be yellow-green, bronze or dark purple in color. Fig trees can range in height from 3 to 9 m (10–30 ft) and can live for 50–75 years depending on conditions. Fig trees are believed to originate from Western Asia.",
  "pests2":"1. Plant only certified seed potatoes - certified seed potatoes are grown in seed beds with zero tolerance of ring rot; remove all crop debris from soil after harvest; sanitize tools and equipment regularly.\n2.Plant potato in well-draining soils with no history of pink rot; avoid overwatering plants; avoid wounding during harvest.",
  "pests3":"1. Treat seeds with appropriate fungicide prior to planting to reduce rot in mature bulbs; avoid bruising bulbs during and after harvest; storing at temeperatures below 15°C (59°F) prevents mold from spreading but it will resume once temperature increases",
  "pests4":"1. Avoid planting seed from infected fields; avoid overhead irrigation; plant less susceptible cultivars.\n2. Avoid planting seed from plants grown in fields where the disease is known to be present",
  "pests5":"1. Encourage natural enemies. Keep the field free from crop debris and weeds. Spraying strong jet of water to dislodge the aphid. If infestation is severe spray suitable insecticide.",
  "pests6":"1. Fumigation may be necessary in soils known or suspected to have carried the disease.\n2. Use pathogens free planting material; if disease is present prune out dead and infected wood and plow under soil; apply an appropriate fungicide",
  "pests7": "1. Avoid planting in poorly draining, cool, wet soil.\n2. Planting in raised beds will help with soil drainage.\n3. Plant high quality seed that germinates quickly.\n4. Treat seeds with fungicide prior to planting to eliminate fungal pathogens.",
  "pests8":"1.Plant resistant varieties; plant only disease-free seed; disinfect all tools and equipment regularly; avoid sprinkler irrigation. 2.Plant resistant varieties if nematodes are known to be present in the soil ;check roots of plants mid-season or sooner if symptoms indicate nematodes; solarizing soil can reduce nematode populations in the soil and levels of inoculum of many other pathogens.",
  "pests9": "1.Infected areas of trees should be pruned out beginning just below the canker. 2.Applications of hoticultural oils or sulfur sprays are effective at controlling blister mites and should be applied if the mites were a problem the previous year; chemical treatments should be applied before bloom.",
